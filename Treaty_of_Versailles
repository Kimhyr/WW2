# Treaty of Versailles

Taking 6 months of negotiations, the Treaty of Versailles was finally signed on
29 June 1919 to end World War 1. It held Germany accountable for starting the
war, punishing Germany with the lost of territory, massive reparations
payments, and demilitarization. Though the treaty was meant to end the War (and
it did), it inspired Adolf Hitler and his NAZI Party to fuel World War 2.
